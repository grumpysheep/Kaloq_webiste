Kaloq does not itself provide banking, money transmission, digital-asset custody, foreign-exchange, card issuance, payment processing, or settlement services. By creating a Kaloq account, accessing the Kaloq platform, or using any feature made available through it, you confirm that you have read, understood, and agreed to these Terms.

Depending on availability, the Kaloq platform may allow you to apply for a payment card, access card-management functions, view balances and transaction information supplied by third-party providers, submit instructions relating to supported bank or wallet transfers, request conversions between supported fiat currencies and digital assets, and access other functions made available through the Kaloq interface. Kaloq does not itself receive, hold, safeguard, custody, or control user funds or digital assets; maintain bank accounts or digital-asset wallets for users; issue payment cards; execute money transfers, digital-asset conversions, or foreign-exchange transactions; authorize, clear, or settle card transactions; operate a card network; provide deposit insurance; or act as a bank, custodian, broker, investment adviser, fiduciary, or money transmitter for users. Any instruction submitted through Kaloq is transmitted to the relevant third-party provider for processing. Kaloq's transmission or display of an instruction does not mean that Kaloq has received, controlled, or executed the underlying funds or transaction.",

Financial Service Providers, not Kaloq, are responsible for the regulated and operational components of the services they provide, including identity and compliance approval, safeguarding or custody, underlying financial accounts, card issuance, transaction authorization, bank and blockchain transfers, conversion, clearing and settlement, reversals, chargebacks, error resolution, and regulatory reporting.

Your use of an underlying financial service is governed by the applicable Provider Terms. Kaloq is not a party to Provider Terms unless the relevant agreement expressly identifies Kaloq as a party. If these Terms conflict with Provider Terms concerning an underlying financial service, the Provider Terms control for that service.

This may include identity and contact information, government-issued identification, tax information, source-of-funds information, and information about your intended use. You authorize Kaloq to collect and securely transmit that information to the Financial Service Providers and verification vendors responsible for reviewing your application. Kaloq may display a status or result received from a Financial Service Provider but does not control the provider's verification methodology, approval standards, or final decision. You must keep your information current. Failure to provide accurate or updated information may result in delayed transactions, restricted access, or termination of the underlying services.",

Once transmitted, an instruction may be irreversible or no longer capable of cancellation. Kaloq is not responsible for an incorrect instruction submitted by you, an incorrect wallet address, use of an unsupported blockchain network, or transfer to an unintended recipient. Kaloq remains responsible to the extent a loss is directly caused by Kaloq transmitting an instruction materially differently from the instruction you validly submitted, subject to the limitations in these Terms.",

Balances and transaction records displayed through Kaloq are based on data received from Financial Service Providers and may be delayed, incomplete, pending, or subject to correction. The records maintained by the responsible Financial Service Provider govern the existence, status, and amount of an underlying financial transaction. Kaloq's interface is not an independent bank statement, custody record, or blockchain record. A displayed balance does not necessarily mean the full amount is immediately available for spending or withdrawal.",

Transfers may be delayed, rejected, returned, frozen, or reviewed because of identity or source-of-funds checks, sanctions or anti-money-laundering controls, provider risk controls, bank processing times, blockchain congestion, incorrect information, asset or network restrictions, technical outages, or legal requirements. Sending an unsupported asset or using an unsupported network may result in permanent loss. Neither Kaloq nor a Financial Service Provider is required to recover incorrectly transferred assets, and recovery may be technically impossible.

The cardholder agreement governs card eligibility and issuance, spending and transaction limits, card funding, authorization and settlement, merchant restrictions, refunds and reversals, unauthorized transactions, chargebacks, card loss or theft, fees, and cardholder rights and obligations. When supported digital assets are used to fund card spending, conversion and settlement are performed by the applicable Financial Service Providers. The merchant ordinarily receives fiat currency through the relevant card network. Kaloq may provide software controls such as displaying transactions or transmitting a request to freeze a card, but final execution remains subject to the systems and rules of the card issuer and other Financial Service Providers.",

Before you confirm an eligible transaction, Kaloq may display pricing information received from a Financial Service Provider. The final amount may differ because of market movement, rate expiration, blockchain network fees, intermediary-bank fees, card-network charges, merchant adjustments, rounding, or other third-party charges. You are responsible for reviewing the final transaction information before confirming.",

A stablecoin may lose its intended value; an issuer may suspend redemption or freeze an asset; a custodian or service provider may experience insolvency, security incidents, or operational failures; blockchain networks may experience congestion, attacks, forks, or outages; transactions may be irreversible; and legal or regulatory changes may restrict an asset, network, or service. Digital assets are not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or an equivalent government deposit-insurance scheme. Any insurance that may apply to a particular fiat deposit must be expressly described in the applicable Provider Terms. No insurance coverage should be assumed based solely on the involvement of a bank or regulated institution. Kaloq does not provide investment, tax, legal, or financial advice. Displaying or supporting an asset is not an endorsement or recommendation.",

        body: "You are responsible for protecting your password, authentication codes, devices, and recovery information. You must notify Kaloq immediately if you believe your account or device has been compromised and must also notify the responsible Financial Service Provider where required by the Provider Terms. Kaloq may restrict access to its interface while a security issue is investigated. Such a restriction does not necessarily freeze or cancel an underlying financial transaction unless the responsible Financial Service Provider separately takes that action.",

        heading: "14. Suspension and Termination",
        body: "Kaloq may suspend or terminate access to its platform if you breach these Terms; we reasonably suspect unauthorized, fraudulent, or unlawful activity; a Financial Service Provider requests or requires the restriction; your underlying provider account is suspended or terminated; continued access creates legal, security, or operational risk; or the relevant service is discontinued. Suspending access to the Kaloq interface does not give Kaloq possession or control of your funds. Withdrawal, return, or treatment of funds following suspension or termination is governed by the applicable Provider Terms and the instructions of the responsible Financial Service Provider.",

Kaloq may receive a complaint and forward it to the responsible provider, but Kaloq does not determine the final outcome of a card dispute, chargeback, transfer reversal, or regulatory investigation. Claims arising solely from the performance or non-performance of an underlying financial service must be brought against the responsible Financial Service Provider under its Provider Terms. This does not exclude a claim directly arising from Kaloq's own breach of these Terms, fraud, willful misconduct, gross negligence, or failure to transmit a valid instruction correctly. Nothing in these Terms limits any non-waivable consumer rights under applicable law.",

    intro: "This Privacy Policy explains how Kaloq (\"Kaloq,\" \"we,\" \"us,\" or \"our\") collects, uses, discloses, and otherwise processes personal information when you visit our website, communicate with us, or use a Kaloq product or service that links to this Policy. The Kaloq entity that contracts with you is responsible for the processing described here. Some account, card, payment, digital-asset, identity-verification, or banking services are provided by regulated or other third-party partners. Those partners may process personal information as independent controllers under their own privacy notices, which also apply to their services.",

        heading: "1. Scope and Our Role",
        body: "This Policy applies to Kaloq-controlled websites, applications, communications, and services that link to it. It does not govern a third party's website, wallet, blockchain protocol, or service simply because it connects to Kaloq. Where a partner provides an account, card, payment, custody, conversion, or identity-verification service, Kaloq and that partner may each determine how certain information is processed for their respective purposes. If a service-specific notice conflicts with this Policy, the more specific notice controls for that service.",

We may also obtain information from public blockchains, sanctions and watchlists, public records, commercially available databases, counterparties, and other sources permitted by law.

Kaloq may review, attribute, or retain on-chain information for transaction processing, compliance, fraud prevention, security, analytics, and dispute resolution. Requests to delete or correct information do not extend to records that Kaloq does not control, including immutable blockchain data.",

Retention periods vary by the type of information, the services involved, the sensitivity and risk of the information, applicable limitation periods, and whether an investigation, claim, legal hold, or enforcement matter is pending. We may retain aggregated or de-identified information where permitted by law and may keep information in backups until it is deleted through ordinary backup cycles.",

        heading: "13. Automated Tools and Risk Decisions",
        body: "We and our partners may use automated tools to support identity verification, sanctions screening, fraud detection, transaction monitoring, security, eligibility, and risk review. These tools may flag, delay, limit, or refer an application or transaction for review. Where applicable law grants rights concerning a decision based solely on automated processing that has legal or similarly significant effects, we will provide the required information and a way to request human review or contest the decision, subject to legal, security, and anti-fraud limitations.",

You may also opt out of marketing emails through the unsubscribe method provided in the message. We may verify your identity and authority before acting on a request, ask for information reasonably needed to process it, and retain a record of the request.
